# Personal Portfolio README

Hello! I'm Tanuj Priyameena, and I made this for the DIG4639 Personal Portfolio project. Below, I will describe the components and features of this.

## Components
- Home page: The main home page, with a short welcome statement.
- About page: A quick descriptive page describing myself.
- Projects page: Three cards describing projects from two of my spring courses. With provided links, to each work.
- Contacts: The contacts page that gives you access to a display form. Additionally, social links to LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram.
- Footer page (persistent): Persistent bottom bar that displays a static message.
- Navigation page (persistent): The upper navigation bar that will help lead users to the four available pages.

## Setup 
1. Create a react app, and download relevant dependencies to assist with display on localhost.
2. Personal suggestion - refer to the code itself, create a components file, and store your JS components there.
3. Design the code, and create app.modules.css to handle modular design, and develop incrementally.
4. Create a repo (if applicable), and link origin.
5. Follow the stage - commit - push changes process.
6. Then, run dependencies and code changes on relevant files for GH pages.
7. Publish to GH pages.
8. Add README Afterwards.

Note on the process: This was the order I followed in essence, but this could be done differently.

## Features
This project has built-in animations (with framer motion), transitions, consistent colors, and a background scheme too. I have built this, such that it could include cards. React Router enables me to utilize multiple pages within this project. CSS modules are utilized throughout, helping to style the page.

Additionally, several links have been provided for my external works, and social links.

Note: This is completely accessible on GitHub!

## Final note
Thanks for viewing the project! This was very enjoyable to do and reveals many different possibilities. Such as icons, page transitions, more diverse pages, and logins!
